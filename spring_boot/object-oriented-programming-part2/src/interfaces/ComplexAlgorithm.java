package interfaces;

// Interfaces make communications between classes, method, projects etc, interface is a contract
// In interface we cannot declare private methods all is public, and the variables defined all always constants no variables
// interfaces is so different to abstact classes.
// In a class you can defined so many interfaces
// in a class you can defined a method but a second method it is to need create a default implementation, for example
// default void nothing1();
