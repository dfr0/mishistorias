ya no se usa gets, ahora se usa fgets


The C library function char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream) reads a line from the specified stream and stores it into the string pointed to by str. It stops when either (n-1) characters are read, the newline character is read, or the end-of-file is reached, whichever comes first.

Declaration
Following is the declaration for fgets() function.

char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream)
Parameters
str − This is the pointer to an array of chars where the string read is stored.

n − This is the maximum number of characters to be read (including the final null-character). Usually, the length of the array passed as str is used.

stream − This is the pointer to a FILE object that identifies the stream where characters are read from.

sizeof(str) is the size of a pointer, like 2, 4 or 8 bytes. Pass to fgets() the size of the memory pointed to by str 

sizeof(str) -> sizeof(char) * cur_max. sizeof(str) is the size of a pointer on your platform (most likely 4 or 8), not the size of the buffer where it points to
